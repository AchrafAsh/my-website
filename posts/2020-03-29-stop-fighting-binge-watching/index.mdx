We all have to work/study from home now. Many friends of mine came to me to complain about how unproductive they are. For some it’s their smartphones, for others it’s Netflix, for some it’s YouTube and Instagram, but it’s always the same problem: binge-watching.

Media consumption is the new most common activity of humankind across the globe. It’s considered as an addiction, a flaw, a waste of time. But is it?

I had to study a lot at home alone throughout the last 3 years. I can’t deny, media consumption was the single one reason why I would procrastinate.

I haven’t addressed this problem to this day, but I don’t consider it as one anymore, I think it’s a blessing!

Media consumption is super powerful, yet “with great power comes great responsibility”. In other words, you need to tame your media consumption before it tames you.

Internet is packed of valuable content. You can learn whatever you want. But I’m not here to convince you to learn something new online. I know you already have a plethora of todos.

Instead, I want to show you how you can leverage media consumption to reach amazing new heights in your life.

If you want to get yourself to something new, be it a new discipline, a new habit, or a completely new lifestyle, it can sometimes feel overwhelming. You’ll probably face lots of resistance as it’s so far from what you currently are accustomed to.

To give you a personal example, I’ve never had a job before. Not even a summer gig, my summers were real unplugged, and unproductive holidays and I’ve never known anything else (no regrets though). But this winter, after teaching myself how to build websites, I wanted more, I wanted to go freelance!

Unfortunately, it was way out of my comfort zone, way beyond my reach. So I thought it would just be one of these exciting goals that at some point you just give up on because you know it’s not realistic.

But this time I had another mindset. I knew upfront there would be too much resistance to attack it outright. So I took another path: getting exposed to freelancers until it feels normal and familiar.

The resistance we feel is just a natural answer from our body when we expose it to something that is too different from the usual. Stay away from the unknown and keep doing what you know.

Media consumption is the easiest way in. It makes the transition seamless and enjoyable. By exposing yourself gradually to the new environment, you make it your new home.

That’s exactly what I did. I’ve looked for all the podcasts, blogs, YouTube channels, newsletters about Freelancing. And to get even better results, I picked the french content creators to get closer to my reality.

It worked!

After a couple of months, freelancing wasn’t scary or far-fetched anymore, it felt like a natural thing to do. I was more like “while we are here, we might at least try it”.

That journey was so liberating! I now feel like I can achieve anything (currently reading daily about AI and machine learning to make them more approachable to learn).

“You are the average of the 5 people you surround yourself with”.

I’m sure it’s not accurate anymore. It’s probably closer to something like:

“You are the average of the 5 people you surround yourself with, plus the people you look up to on social media.

So if you want to significantly disrupt your status quo, start exposing yourself to content from people you look up to.

And if you want to go an extra step further, I’ve explained last week how to set a consistent set of habits. Because knowing is great, but it’s useless until you actually do something with it.

Stop feeling miserable for binge-watching, instead leverage the power of media consumption to take big leaps in your life.
