I see all over the place how it's the best time to do millions of things. Some also complain about this mindset of wanting to optimize even this period of crisis. 

I understand both sides, and I don't think one is better, smarter or wiser than the other. But I've personally chosen the former and stayed in my dorm instead of going back home. The goal was to catch up on all the things I've put aside for lack of time.

I now have time, but how do I actually get things done?

Because all I've done so far is wasting time browsing YouTube and scrolling on Twitter.

"What you need is motivation !" "No ! You need discipline !"

I say neither of them really help you concretely. I'm from a scientific background, so I need tangible methods, not theories or mindsets.

And I think I've found one:

*Make it a habit!*

When you think about it, it's only normal that I've faced some resistance. I was trying to completely change my day to day routine from one day to the other.

The best you can hope with this is to have one productive day and then blank...

Here's a safer way to operate: adopt new habits.

‚ÄúWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.‚Äù - Aristotle

In other words: ‚ÄúExcellence is a habit.‚Äù

So no more talking, here is my process:

## STEP 1: define your Areas of Focus
In whatever form you want, map out your main Areas of Focus, i.e any aspect of your life that you want to focus on, that you want to improve.

Obviously, these areas are always changing, so don't overthink it, just pick whatever feels obvious at the moment. And make sure you are honest with yourself, don't choose what you should focus on, but only what you want to focus on.

## STEP 2: define your goals
For each Area of Focus, list the objectives, projects, milestones you want to accomplish.

Don‚Äôt limit yourself to what is feasible. Forget about SMART goals. Just put what feels exciting to you right now, even if you have no clue how you'll get there.

We usually stop there thinking: "Just do it!". Well if you have the discipline to, congrats. But if you're like me, you won't kick yourself in the butt to do something unless you have clear instructions. YouTube is watching me, the moment I hesitate, it strikes! And I find myself binge-watching.

The critical step is the last one:

## STEP 3: the Power of Habits
‚ÄúYou are what you do every day‚Äù

Now that you have a list of projects/goals, define one or two habits for each of them, that will allow you to accomplish them.

What is super important is to set an hour and duration for every habit. But don‚Äôt expect too much. It‚Äôs better to stick to 30 minutes per day over the course of several months, rather than 2 hours and give up after a week because you never find the time.

If you want to teach yourself programming, stick to 30 minutes of online courses, every day, at 8pm. If you'd like to take the opportunity to read more, dedicate 30 minutes every day before bed to reading.

It's really that simple. Now you have a clear vision of what you have to do throughout the day. 

Forget about the bigger picture, just commit to a few new habits and appreciate the constant progress.

PS: It‚Äôs actually not that easy to stick to new habits, but I have effective tips to help you üòâ
