After trying several technos, I’ve now kind of find my favourite workflow.

Why do you need a workflow to build websites
During my #20DaysOfCode, I discovered how easier it is to build a website once you have a well-designed mockup.

In the past, I was trying things as I went along the project. The problem with that is that the design is usually poor and inconsistent, and the structure is shaky because you don’t have the overall architecture of the page.

Designing the website
I now use Figma (amazing web app) to create mockups. I try to find inspiration on Pinterest at that stage. I should also try Dribble as lots of designers use it as their portfolio.

Once I’m satisfied with the design, I have to write the code.

Coding a static website
To create static websites I love using Gatsby. It’s a React framework with lots of advantages:

Server Side Rendered (SSR) which is great for SEO and performance
plugins for quick add-ons: google analytics, image optimization, SEO, ...
you have different CMS (Content Management System)  to choose from and that is really easy to set up and use (Contentful, Markdown, Netlify, ...)
You can create blogs, e-commerce websites and others in no-time.

Deploy a Gatsby website and set up a deployment pipeline with Netlify
Once I’ve gone from the mockup to the actual website, I have to deploy.

Actually, I like deploying in early-stage of the project to avoid discovering big issues at the end. But to make it even better, I set up a simple deploying workflow thanks to Netlify.

It’s really dead simple. You sign up to Netlify using your Github credentials, and then you can pick any repo you want to deploy (for free !).

Netlify automatically detects Gatsby projects and deals with the (small) DevOps (building etc).

And then, once it’s deployed, you just have to push your commits to your Github repo and it will automatically deploy the new version. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

And that’s all there is to it.

With a little bit of practice, I can now design, build and deploy a website within a day (here’s an example of my portfolio).
