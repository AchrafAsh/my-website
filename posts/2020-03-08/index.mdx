Yesterday I’ve completed not a #100DaysOfCode but a #20DaysOfCode challenge. 20 days during which you build a small 1-day coding project.
## Why this challenge?
For a couple of months, I’ve been wanting to go freelance. However, I always find something new that I have to learn before I can take any project. 

So I decided that I would give myself 20 days to learn the most important things to get started but after that, no more excuses!

## How it benefited me?
To bring the challenge a step further, I thought it was the opportunity to start engaging on Twitter. I set myself to publish on Twitter my daily projects.
How you can apply it to anything really

I’ve said it before, consistency is the key to any success. First, you define your OKRs (Objectif Key Results), but then you have to execute. And if you’re not consistent you won’t get any results. Intensity is worth nothing without consistency.

Whether you want to get better at a discipline you are already practising, whether you want to start something new, committing to a 20DaysOfCode-like challenge will bring you more results than you could imagine.

Let me give you an example. I’m consuming a lot of content related to freelancing (podcasts, articles) and I’ve been following closely two freelancers. The first one has a podcast, which made me discover the second (who is a developer that has an amazing personal branding). Thanks to a Tweet I’ve managed to get the attention of both, plus the first one (podcaster) shout me out, tweeting “This guy is building BIG personal branding”!
## Conclusion:
If you want to boost your accomplishments, don’t increase intensity but rather your consistency. Commit to a sprint (20 days, 30 days, 100 days) during which you produce something every single day.

You might think that you already have to much go on right now. I would still advise you to try it even if you have to take really small projects. The point is not to create amazing stuff and to dedicate all your time to get better.

The point is to force yourself to be more consistent and get 1% better every day rather than 2% every month. And on top of that, it will open other opportunities (like mine).

Don’t wait to have time, take the time today to commit every day and figure out what you can create with the time you have.
