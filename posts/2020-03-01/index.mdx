I’ve always had great ambitions and motivation. I’m willing to make an endeavour when it’s needed. But it’s only true when the order to work hard comes from someone else, parents, teachers, coaches...

Why can’t I put that same effort and determination on my own projects?

I know I’m not the only one to suffer from this. We usually blame the lack of motivation. 

And that’s far from being true. It’s just a way to fool ourselves thinking that an external factor is preventing us from achieving our goals. This great article explains why motivation is a myth and how discipline is the way forward.

So let’s forget right away about motivation and that kind of cheesy stuff.
## What makes a huge undertaker different than us
From all the content I’ve dissected, about people who achieve great things, I’ve noticed one single common point. 

There’s such a large spectrum of personalities, qualities and setbacks in this category of people that it’s hard to come with a a of causality. It’s both confusing and encouraging. Can anybody become a great achiever? Is it only a contextual thing, given the right timing and relationships you can belong to them?

“Anyone can become an entrepreneur, but not everyone is”. That’s exactly it. Anyone can become a great achiever, there are no prerequisites, but it doesn’t mean that everyone will become one.

Because there’s this one little difference that will prevent us from crossing the line in the sand, and that is: executing.

*Just do it.*

I know. I’m sorry. I also hated that speech. So let me rephrase it so that it sounds less inspiration-like.

People who undertake huge actions are people who can dream big, but more importantly, who can immediately act on it and take the road towards that dream.

We all have big dreams, big goals, big aspirations, but 99% of us will stay there, never commit to the first step towards it.

If you want to become an amazing undertaker you only need to execute. Stay how you are, this is what defines you. You don’t need to change. You just need to do everything you can to make ideas become reality. (I’ll expound on that point as it’s way more complex than that)

**But how do you go from idea to action?**
## Get your ideas out of your head
I’ve struggled a lot with that part. I spend days, weeks and even months dreaming, researching, planning and then when it’s time to execute, I just freeze. I’m overwhelmed.

A couple of days ago I’ve met a life-entrepreneur (it’s not a job, it’s in his blood) who told me to always share my ideas, goals, dreams, with people close to you. And so I asked him, how. Because I always feel alone, misunderstood or discouraged. He just seemed to don’t give a fuck about the reaction. All that count is that you bring what’s inside your brain to the public. The purpose isn’t feedback, support or advice, but making your idea belong to the real world. 

*Stop overthinking the process.*

When I went back from that conversation, I talked with a close friend of my <a target='_blank' href='https://studentexperiment.blogspot.com/2020/02/my-master-plan.html'>big 4-year plan</a>, and I have to admit that it changed everything. It feels like I’m already enrolled in the execution and that I can’t go back. Now his watching and I’m accountable.
