          <p>
            This my first real-life project. I've met two amazing students at my
            school who are building this really cool app called Flips. The point
            is to match like-minded students at an event of a common interst.
            <br />
            I immediately wanted to give them a helping-hand and the timing was
            perfect.
            <br /> Here is a preview of the projects:

            The point of this challenge is to build something every single day
            for 20 days.
