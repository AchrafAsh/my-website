            How to start a freelance business while being a full-time student

          <h1>Learning a new skill</h1>
          <p>I want to try something new!</p>
          <p>
            After blogging for almost a year now, I realized how difficult and yet powerful writing
            is. So I've been wanting to craft my copywriting skills for a while now. But learning
            without an endgoal isn't funny at all...
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>But now I have one: selling copywriting services online.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Here's what I want to do:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>enroll in skillshare courses on copywriting</li>
            <li>practicing a ton to get better and build a portfolio</li>
            <li>selling copywriting gigs on Fiverr.</li>
          </ol>
        </Container>
        <Container>
          <h1>Side Projects</h1>
          <h2>An easy and quick way to validate your next idea</h2>
          <p>
            Post a Form on any forum to ask people if they are excited about your idea. I think the
            best platform to do that is Reddit. Just because you can find a subreddit for anything
            you can think of.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've tried the method only once so far. The result was negative but far from being
            disappointing.
          </p>
          <p>I'll write a quick blog post to share everything with you.</p>
