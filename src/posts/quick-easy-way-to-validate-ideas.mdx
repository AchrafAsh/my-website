I think we all make the mistake of building a product only to discover months later that our idea is not worth pursuing.
Especially as a dev, building the product is the most satisfying part of the project. But it's not the right way to start your side-project.

Before doing anything else, we need to figure out if our idea is even worth spending more time and energy on it.

It can be simple to do, but there are a few things you need to be aware of.

# Warning: people are unconscious lyers

One might think that the easiest way to validate their idea is to ask their friends and family.

WRONG!!!

You'll only face two extreme answers:
* your ideas are always crap
* your ideas are always awesome

The worst thing is that they almost never believe what they say. And that's absolutely normal, they're biased.

You should never based your decisions on the feedback of people you know.

# A simple and general idea

There's a more unbiased and general way of asking people.

You create a form (google form, typeform,...) respecting the followings:
* make every question optional (any participation, even lacunar, is welcome)
* ask for email at the end if interested in the idea (again, should be optional)
* make your questions as open as possible (but not so much that answering is annoying, e.g "What's your biggest pain?")

Find relevant forums to post your form. Be brief and avoid sales pitch. Be transparent and show empathy.

> All questions are optional and I don't ask for personal info."

# How to know when your idea is worth pursuing

If people get excited about your idea and leave you their email address, you might be into something. But be clear from the start what number will make you follow the idea.

If you haven't passed that threshold, and don't see any real excitment, it might be wiser to forget about it and find something else.

# Example

My idea: a chrome extension to apply custom styles to any website (e.g dark mode in google drive), plus custom keyboard shortcuts.
Validation process:

*video coming soon*

Results:

*images coming soon*

To be honest I was surprised to have a few emails and that many answers.

However my threshold was 20 positive answers. I'm way below and the idea doesn't seem to sink in.

It's a NO for this one, but I'm glad I haven't spend weeks to build it to realize too late nobody wants it.

# Conclusion

Validating your idea this way might spare you weeks of effort, time and even some money.

The chrome extension was in my head for a moment and to be honest I thought it was a good idea.

Disclaimer: take this method with a pinch of salt. There's no method that can give you 100% insurance. You might have positive feedback but find out later that the idea was bad. Or the opposite. It's just meant to help you make a decision.
