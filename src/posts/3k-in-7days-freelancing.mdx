Last April, [I decided to go down the freelance path while studying in college](https://www.achrafash.me/blog/freelance-business-for-students/).
Nothing really happened until August when I got my first real project. About 3 months later I:

- made a total of 12K‚Ç¨
- just signed a 7-day project at 3K‚Ç¨
- get recurrent calls for new projects
- worked with a famous cosmetic luxury brand and a big university (Paris)

Let's see how it all happened.

# üöÄ Explosive start

I had an amazing first step in my freelance journey. I started off with a huge project for √âst√©e Lauder and an ambitious deadline: 1 month to build a vritual event platform.
I had to integrate Zoom into the platform, create the onboarding (signup/login, email verification), setup CI/CD, configure Linux servers, and a ton of other things.
To be honest, 70% of the things I did was learnt doing it üòÅ.

This project went awesome and gave me a huge boost in confidence. Plus many people were involved in the project and they loved my work which got me a ton of credibility (and also recurrent offers).

# üòñ Impostor Syndrom

After this project, I took a handful of smaller projects. But I never realised what my work was worth.
I would price ridiculously low because I felt like it wasn't big asks. I almost felt bad to ask money for something I love doing.

To give you an example, one previous client was using a tool that would retrieve their job offers from Linkedin and post them on their website.
The Linkedin API evolved and broke this automation. They asked me to find a solution and after browsing the API I concluded it wasn't possible to find a quick fix.
But then I thought of hacking together a solution by building a chrome extension and a custom API, which end up working great. I prototyped it in less than 10 hours without telling them.
When I told them about the solution (but not that I already have a working prototype) they liked it and asked for a price. As I already had 80% of the job done, I only asked for 300‚Ç¨.
Looking back, I should have asked for at least 3 times that amount. The tool they were using costs 50‚Ç¨/month so I'm saving them 600‚Ç¨/year (and time because the tool wasn't perfectly fitted to their workflow and needed additional tweaks).

# ü§ë Decomplexing about money & experimenting new pricing strategies

After a ton of other bad project pricing, I took the time to rethink my methodology. I knew from the beginning about value-based pricing, but it requires a lot of experience and confidence.
However, I wasn't even pricing based on the time spent. I would just give a price I thought would make everybody happy.
So I decided to at least define my daily rate and estimate the time I would spend before pricing, i.e having a defined pricing strategy.

At the same time, I had a last minute call to build a platform for finals using Zoom... in 7 days!
It seemed like an insane ask, so I reckon I could do the same and ask for 10k üòÖ
Unfortunately my colleague got cold feet and told me he couldn't justfy such daily rate.
Even though I think it was reasonable given the work and short deadline, I still managed to negociate 3k for the job üòé (and it ended up being quite easy ü§´)

# ‚öñ Finding balance

As a college student it's hard to find the right balance. A part of me wants to go all in and approach bigger clients and take bigger responsibilities.
It would mean more exciting projects, more value-based pricing, more engagement. But I can't assume too much responsibilities because I might stop my activity at any time for an internship for example.
For this reason I want to take a month or two off to look at the bigger picture. After all, I also want to become a prolific maker and a great machine learning engineer/researcher.
