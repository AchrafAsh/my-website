I've publicly commited to reach ramen profitability by the end of 2021...
My goal is to become a prolific maker, starting summer 2020!

I always thought ideas was the biggest obstacle, but it's definitely not!
Ideas aren't that hard to find it's just a mindset to get.

The challenging part is the execution!

So here it is, my list of ideas with updates about where I am with it.

## Personal Relationship Management [üí°]

* Idea: I got the idea from all the videos and podcasts of Ali Abdaal.
He and his brother suggested we manage life like business.
Every business has a CRM to manage their customers and partners.

Why not using an equivalent system to manage our personal relationships?

* State: I'm starting with a spreadsheet to figure out where it can be interesting,
what type of data is needed, ...

## Evergreen Blog [üí°]

* Idea: I want to create a blogging platform that enhance evergreen posts by making the reading 
experience more enjoyable, the editing part as well.

* State: I've posted on Indie Hackers asking if I was stealing the idea.
Responses were very encouraging and I got a few people reaching back because they were interested.

## No-Code Onboarding [üïµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]

* Idea: I've been obsessed with UI/UX design lately and particularly onboarding. I'm following a couple of newsletters 
in which they breakdown popular apps onboarding (spotify, netflix).
## AI Fluency Assistant [üïµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]

* Idea: you give a short sentence and a recording of the user reading it and an API would return a score and ideally hints to explain where it could be better etc... 

* State: I'm figuring out what type of machine learning I can use (if any). I want to test a recent model that is using both CNN and LSTM.
This model is better than previous ones that were hand extracting features from the audio. CNN are more powerful at figuring out high-level features and LSTM makes it possible 
to consider the time dimension. The last part will be to use Attention Mechanism to find the weak points in pronunciation.

## Internship platform [üí°]

* Idea: job boards have been going crazy lately. But as I'm looking for life-changing internships, I can't find any equivalent for that purpose.
Internship are fairly short and we only have a couple of them. I really want to make the most out of it and so I'm making a ton of research to find 
contacts of Alumni who can direct me towards the best opportunities.

* State: just got the idea as I was struggling myself... might do a canvas exercise.



* Final thought: I don't think it's a good idea to pursue all these ideas at once. But I think recording them somewhere and thinking about it regularly 
also helps validating it. With time, ideas either die out or consolidates. I believe makers who built their product in a weekend had the ideas in the back of their mind for weeks.*
