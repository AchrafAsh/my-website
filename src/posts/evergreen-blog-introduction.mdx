I've discovered the [evergreen-note](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) concept a few weeks ago and I've been procrastinating 
on starting cultivating my own forest. So here we are, finally!

# What is an evergreen note
Our thoughts and interests tend to turn around the same few spheres: 
productivity, finance, passive income, or whatever your spiel is.

Even if your curious - I definitely am - you'll still converge towards the same topics 
and ideas over and over again.

If you feel like it's not the case, think about that:
> You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. 
> So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. 
> You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
> - Steve Jobs

# Workflow to write evergreen notes
I'll start by writing very generic content about the topics I'm most interested in.
From there I'll be able to expand on more niche subjects.

I'll probably end up with different formats. All I can think of right now is:
1. chronological notes (e.g. to document my freelance journey)
2. tree of notes (e.g. to dig deeper as I learn new skills)

<br/>
<br/>

*FLASH INFO: I'm currently [considering building a tool for people to share their evergreen notes](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/am-i-stealing-the-idea-i-need-your-help-9224d8937f).
It would be like a blogging platform alternative. To be continued...*

# What's the point of sharing publicly
Firstly, it's a way of making me [accountable](https://achrafash.me/lab). Having to write/publish something every Sunday 
forces me to show up. I'll have to actively grow my forest, process what I consume and explain
my newly acquired knowledge.

Secondly, it's gonna be like a curated blog. You'll be able to find snippets of knowledge,
explained in an understable fashion.

# Topics I'm gonna tackle
Even though I like to learn new skills and change goals, systems and habits every week,
I've lately been able to connect the dots.

Here's my spiel:
* web and mobile development
* UI/UX design
* marketing and copywriting
* startups, side projects, online businesses
* freelancing (as a student)
* growth hacks
* machine learning and deep learning research

Hope you'll find a few nuggets in my garden ðŸ˜‰
